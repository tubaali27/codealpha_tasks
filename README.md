1) Iris-Flower-Classification-ML-Model:
   
Objective: Classify iris flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

Libraries: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.

The Iris flower classification model serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It demonstrates how to apply various classification algorithms to a real-world problem and provides insights into the importance of feature selection and model evaluation metrics.

2) Car-Price-Prediction-ML-model:
   
This project implements a machine learning solution to accurately predict car prices based on various vehicle attributes. By analyzing historical car data, the system identifies patterns and relationships between car features and their market values, enabling precise price estimations for new vehicles.

3) Sales-Prediction-using-Python:

The aim of this project is to predict sales based on advertising expenditure using the given dataset. The dataset contains information about advertising spending on different platforms (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and the corresponding sales amount.
